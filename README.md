# 8 Queens AI Programming Assignment 

This program is a genetic algorithm implementation for the 8-Queens puzzle, a problem in which the goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The GA operates on a population of potential solutions applying the principles of biological evolutionâ€”selection, crossover, and mutation.
In this program, each individual solution is represented as a list of eight numbers, each number representing the column position of a queen in the corresponding row. The fitness function is crucial in guiding the GA towards the solution and is designed to penalize configurations where queens are attacking each other. The fitness score starts at 28, the total number of non-attacking pairs of queens, and decrements for each pair of queens in conflict. The selection of parents for producing the next generation is probabilistic, favoring individuals with higher fitness.
The crossover function combines two parents to produce offspring by mixing their genes at a random point, whereas mutation introduces randomness by altering a random gene in an offspring, which helps to maintain diversity within the population and prevent premature convergence to local optima. The parameters used in this GA include a population size of 100, a number of iterations capped at 100, a mutation chance of 5%, and a fitness threshold of 27 for early stopping.
Upon running the program, the GA was able to produce a solution with a fitness score of 26 within 10 generations. The fitness score of 26 indicates that the solution had only one pair of queens in a position where they could attack each other, which is close to the optimal solution. The plot of the GA's performance over time shows the average and best fitness scores per generation, highlighting the evolutionary improvement. The best fitness line indicates the highest fitness score in each generation, which reaches a plateau once the GA finds a high-scoring solution. In contrast, the average fitness line shows the mean fitness score of the entire population, which gradually improves as the GA progresses.
In the updated execution of the genetic algorithm (GA) with the `numIterations` increased to 1000, we observe a more detailed performance trajectory over the generations. 
The initial population's fitness values varied, indicating a diverse genetic makeup. This diversity is crucial for the GA, as it allows for a broader exploration of the solution space. As the GA continued through the generations, we observed an overall upward trend in the average fitness of the population, suggesting that the population was, on average, getting closer to the optimal solution.
The best fitness line shows several spikes where the algorithm found particularly good solutions. These spikes are followed by plateaus, where the best solution of the population did not improve for some generations. This pattern shows that for GA, improvements can be sporadic and often come after periods of little or no progress.
With more iterations, the GA had more opportunities to refine its solutions, which is evident by the best solution being found at iteration 114 with a perfect fitness score of 28. This is the optimal score for the 8-Queens problem, meaning that the solution had no queens attacking each other. It is interesting to note that the GA stopped early at iteration 320 due to the average fitness exceeding the predefined threshold of 27.16. This early stopping is a practical feature as it prevents unnecessary computation after achieving satisfactory results.
The increased number of iterations provided a more nuanced understanding of the GA's performance. It allowed the GA to work through more potential solutions and variations, which contributed to finding the optimal solution and a higher average fitness across the population.
Comparing the results of 100 iterations to 1000, the most significant difference is the improved outcome with more iterations. With 100 iterations, the GA did not reach an optimal solution, indicating that it had not fully explored the solution space. With 1000 iterations, not only did the GA find an optimal solution, but the overall fitness of the population also improved, as reflected by the average fitness score. This illustrates the importance of allowing the GA sufficient time to evolve the population, balancing exploration and exploitation to find the best possible solution.
